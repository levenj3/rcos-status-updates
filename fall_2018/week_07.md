## Last Week's Accomplishments
Things have slowed down. Not really sure how to help with the refactor, so I started on a new issue - which is proving to be more complicated than I thought.

## This Week's Plan
Work on the aforementioned.

## Anything Blocking?
The code can be a little confusing. It also kind of feels a little pointless to implement features or fix bugs in the midst of a major refactor. It's probably more important to work on that.
