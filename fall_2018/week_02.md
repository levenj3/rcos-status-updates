## Last Week's Accomplishments

Resolved my first issue! Javascript isn't that different and the existing codebase is pretty clean.

## This Week's Plan

Fix the new bug that I caused.

## Anything Blocking?

> Accidentally created a bug in resolving the aforementioned issue. Isn't that bad though.

> Been busy, it can be hard to motivate myself to sit down and work on this project.
